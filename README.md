For our final project at Makers Academy, we built an application using the MERN stack, which allows the user to play language-learning quizzes. The quizzes are designed to replicate simple scenarios which the user may find themselves in during their travels (e.g. ordering in a restaurant)

Future Additions
-------

Due to the time constraints of the project, we had to prioritize the features we wanted to add. These user stories are for features we will look to add in the future:

```
As a user 
So I can improve my pronunciation 
I want to be able to hear example audio
```
```
As a user
So I can satisfy my competitiveness
I want to see a leaderboard
```
```
As a user 
So I can follow my story 
I want to see the outcome of my chosen answer
```

We will also look to refactor our code by:
- extracting the questions and answers into a database 
- ensuring all our methods follow the Single Responsibility Principle
- DRYing up our code
